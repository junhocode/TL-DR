I don't know how to be nice\n\
Better catch the sign, 'cause I never say shit twice\n\
Dripped out in diamonds, but my fit 'ready shines\n\
I miss the times, but I don't wanna rewind\n\

Dropped out, can't ever fuck with you\n\

I respect the OGs 'less they stay seated in them priority seats, ay\n\

Even if I don't sing melodies again, would you still count on me?\n\
Keep the flow, 'cause I quite like the way it is\n\
Feels like home when I am lyin' in your sheets\n\

I know, you hate to be alone, yeah\n\
Feelin' low, but we too grown, yeah, huh\n\
I know, if you were in my clothes,\n\
you'd keep me close, but we too grown, yeah\n\
